  description: Bumblebees are covered in soft hairs that make them fuzzy. However,
    they have a bare spot on their hindleg that is surrounded by longer hairs. This
    area is called a "pollen basket". When the bees collect nectar, flower pollen
    sticks to this basket and from there pollinates other flowers.
  catchPhrase: Just a round little friend :]
